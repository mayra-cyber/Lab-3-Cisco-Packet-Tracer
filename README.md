# Lab 3 — Cisco Packet Tracer Network Simulation

## Objective
Install and configure Cisco Packet Tracer to create a virtual environment for designing, testing, and troubleshooting network topologies without physical hardware.

## Environment
- Host OS: Windows 11  
- Network Type: LAN  

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer  

## What I Built
- Installed Cisco Packet Tracer
- Created a simulation environment for:
  - Network topology design
  - IP addressing
  - Device configuration
  - Network troubleshooting
  - IoT device simulation

## Setup Process
- Created a Cisco Networking Academy account  
- Enrolled in a free course to gain download access  
- Downloaded and installed Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Verified successful installation on desktop  

## Why This Matters in IT & Cybersecurity
Cisco Packet Tracer allows engineers and analysts to:
- Design and test network architectures
- Simulate traffic flow
- Practice router and switch configuration
- Identify misconfigurations
- Model secure network designs

This is a core tool used in networking, IT support, and cybersecurity training.

## Outcome
Cisco Packet Tracer was successfully installed and is ready for building and troubleshooting network simulations.

## Reflection
This lab gave me access to an enterprise-grade network simulator where I can design, test, and validate IP schemes, routing, and device configurations without needing physical hardware.
